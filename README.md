###Simple Word Count Parser Example
=================

So this is a super simple parser example. The tutorial is located here: 
<a href="http://www.jonathanbeard.io/tutorials/FlexBisonC++.html" target="_blank">link</a>

Between the tutorial and the code you should be able to get started with more advanced projects using C++ and Flex/Bison. Admittedly the example itself is a bit contrived, however it's mean to be simple and get the point across. If there are changes in Flex/Bison that prevent the example from compiling or if you just have improvements, feel free to generate a pull request or just shoot me an e-mail. 

Thanks!
